# Shop_Management_System-Cpp
Shop Management System is a C++ console application. 
I coded this console application as a completion project when I had finished my C++ course from cousera. 
I tried to implement the ideas and concept I learned throughout the course in this application. 

The application offers following features..
````
Admin Authentication / Create Account
Reset Password 
Add products to the shop, along with their necessary detail
Save the products in database(file)
Add new employees in the shop/ manage them
Save employees record
...... And more actually.
